This code implements the single-image illumination estimation technique
introduced in 

J.-F. Lalonde, A. A. Efros, and S. G. Narasimhan, "Estimating the Natural 
Illumination Conditions from a Single Outdoor Image," International 
Journal of Computer Vision, vol. 98, no. 2, pp. 123--145, Jun. 2012.

Please cite this paper if you use this code in your work.

*NEW*: Now *much* easier to run on your own images! See below.

Getting started
===============

1.  First, make sure you download the required software packages described below.
2.  From the MATLAB command prompt in the `mycode` directory, run

        $ setPath
        $ demoEstimateIllumination

3.  Results should display automagically!


Requirements
============

* MATLAB's optimization toolbox

Requires some of my software packages (available on github):

* My [utils](http://www.github.com/jflalonde/utils) package;
* My [shadowDetection](http://www.github.com/jflalonde/shadowDetection) package;

Requires the following 3rd-party libs (included):

* [LibSVM](http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm), included in `3rd_party/libsvm-mat-3.0-1`;
* [Felzenszwalb et al. object detector](http://www.cs.uchicago.edu/~pff/latent) [1], included in `3rd_party/voc-release3.1`;
* [Piotr Dollar's image processing toolbox](http://vision.ucsd.edu/~pdollar/toolbox/doc/), included in `3rd_party/piotr_toolbox`.
* [Video Compass code from Derek Hoiem](http://www.cs.illinois.edu/homes/dhoiem/), included in `3rd_party/hoiemVideoCompass`;

For the paths to work "out of the box", create yourself a base directory 
(e.g. `code`), and download all of the packages in that directory. For
example, `code/utils`, `code/skyModel`, `code/illuminationSingleImage`...
The `setPath` function should be able to find them. 

Running the code on your own images
------------------

It is now *much* easier to run the code on your own images! All you have to 
do is to set the `demoMode` flag to `false` and it will automatically compute
the geometric context and the ground shadow boundaries. 

You will need to make sure the following packages are installed and running
(refer to their respective websites for installation instructions):

* geometric context, code available from [Derek Hoiem's website](http://www.cs.illinois.edu/homes/dhoiem);
* detected ground shadow boundaries, code available from [my website](http://www.jflalonde.org/software.html#shadowDetection).

Finally, you also need to make sure that they, as well as all their dependencies,
are added to the path. See the `setPath.m` function for a starting point.

Compilation
===========

Compile the object detector: 

* go to `3rd_party/voc-release3.1` from inside matlab, and run 'compile'

Compile the lib-svm

* go to `3rd_party/libsvm-mat-3.0-1` from inside matlab, and run 'make'

Follow the compilation instructions of the `utils` package.


Notes
=====

1. By default, this code uses the ICCV'09 version to estimate the probability 
of the sun given the sky cue, my previous implementation seems to give better
results. 

2. If you experience problems with libsvm version 3.0.1, replace the `svm_model_matlab.c` file with the following: https://github.com/tomz/libsvm-ruby-swig/blob/master/libsvm-3.1/matlab/svm_model_matlab.c. Make sure that the `NUM_OF_RETURN_FIELD` macro is set to 10. Recompile libsvm after making this change. 
*Thanks heaps to Swaminathan Sankaranrayanan for pointing this out!*

3. Alternatively, the software apparently works with libsvm version 3.1. Thanks to Lin Gu for pointing this out. 

4. If matlab complains that it can't find the function `xrepmat`, you can either install the [lightspeed](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/minka/software/lightspeed/) package by Tom Minka, or safely replace all the `xrepmat` by the built-in `repmat`. 

5. The "sky illumination" code was broken recently due to a change in the `skyModel` repo. Please pull! 
*Thanks to Yannick Hold-Geoffroy for finding that bug!*

Coordinates
===========

The world coordinates `(x,y,z)` have the following reference frame:

<pre><code>
     ^ y
     |
     |
     .----> x
    /
z  v
</code></pre>
  
The camera is looking in the negative `z` direction. For convenience (or just to 
make things more complicated), we define `azimuth=0` to be the camera viewing
direction, and `azimuth>0` points towards the right of the camera. 
Therefore, to convert from spherical to cartesian coordinates, you should use:

    x = sin(zenith).*sin(azimuth);
    y = cos(zenith);
    z = -sin(zenith).*cos(azimuth);
